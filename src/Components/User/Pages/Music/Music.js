                    Tobi Peter is a songwriter, DJ, music producer & animator. The Lagos based producer takes musical inspiration from <span>Thomas Wesley</span> (also known as <span>Diplo</span>).
                    Much like <span>Diplo</span>, Tobi Peter makes music across a wide range of genres. In recent times, he has established himself as a producer to be reckoned with as long as EDM, house or amapiano in Nigeria is concerned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While DJing, Tobi Peter can be seen wearing his signature blue agbada which serves as an appeal to the eyes while he serenades the audience with his unique set.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He has received praise and commendation for his artistic display both as an animator and a producer from <span>Diplo, Walshy Fire, Major Lazer, Major League Djz, Don Jazzy, Dr Sid, M.I., Falz the Bahd Guy</span> amongst others.
                </p>
                <p>Tobi has put out 6 EPs in his career as a producer/DJ with his latest release cementing his status as an elite amapianoÂ producer.</p>
